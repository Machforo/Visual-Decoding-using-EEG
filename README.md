# Visual-Decoding-using-EEG
Visual Decoding from EEG explores reconstructing images from EEG signals using models like BLIP, MiDAS, VAE, CLIP, and Stable Diffusion. This multimodal pipeline aligns EEG, textual, and depth features to decode visual stimuli, advancing brain-computer interfaces and assistive tech.
